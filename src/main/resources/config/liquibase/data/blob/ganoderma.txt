Ganoderma is a genus of polypore fungi in the family Ganodermataceae that includes about 80 species, many from tropical regions.[1] They have a high genetic diversity and are used in traditional Asian medicines. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores because they have a double-walled basidiospore. They may be called shelf mushrooms or bracket fungi. (Wikipedia contributors. (2022, November 23).
